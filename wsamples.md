Here are some writing examples from my professional and academic careers:
<ul>
<li>A typical NV5 Geospatial (Quantum Spatial) <a href="/Quantum Spatial_ Nashua NH- Technical Proposal_IH edits.pdf">response</a> for a photogrammetric mapping project</li>
<li>An academic paper conducting a light rail study written for my masters program at Cal Poly Pomona</li>
<li>An InDesign book for my Urban Design class at CPP</li>
<li>A typical presentation deck for Singularity University, created in Google Slides</li>
</ul>
